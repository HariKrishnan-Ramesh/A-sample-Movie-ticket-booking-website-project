# Movie Ticket Booking Website Project

This project is a simple movie ticket booking website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. It allows users to browse movies, select showtimes, and book tickets.

## Overview

The website provides the following functionalities:

*   **Movie Listing:** Displays a list of available movies with details like title, poster, and synopsis.
*   **Showtime Selection:** Allows users to choose a showtime for a selected movie.
*   **Seat Selection:** Provides a visual representation of available seats in the theater.
*   **Booking Confirmation:** Confirms the booking details and displays a ticket confirmation.
*   **Admin Panel (Basic):** Includes a rudimentary admin panel for managing movies and showtimes (details are basic and might need further development).

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML
    *   CSS
    *   JavaScript

*   **Backend:**
    *   PHP
    *   MySQL

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HariKrishnan-Ramesh/A-sample-Movie-ticket-booking-website-project.git
    cd A-sample-Movie-ticket-booking-website-project
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**

    *   Create a MySQL database (e.g., `movie_booking`).
    *   Import the database schema from the `database.sql` file (if provided - check the repository for a SQL file or create your own based on the project's needs).

3.  **Configuration:**

    *   Update the database connection details (host, username, password, database name) in the PHP files (e.g., `config.php` or similar configuration file)

4.  **Web Server:**

    *   Deploy the project files to a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP enabled.  Make sure the web server's document root points to the project's root directory.

5.  **Access the Website:**

    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where the project is deployed (e.g., `http://localhost/movie_booking`).

## Key Files and Structure

*   `index.php` (or similar): Main page displaying movie listings.
*   `booking.php` (or similar): Handles the booking process.
*   `admin/` (directory): Contains admin panel files (if available).
*   `css/` (directory): Contains CSS stylesheets.
*   `js/` (directory): Contains JavaScript files.
*   `includes/` (directory, if present): Includes common files like database connection scripts.

## Important Considerations

*   **Security:** This project appears to be a basic example.  It likely lacks security features like input validation and protection against SQL injection.  **Do not use this code in a production environment without addressing security vulnerabilities.**
*   **Admin Panel:** The admin panel functionality might be limited.  You may need to develop it further to manage movies, showtimes, and bookings effectively.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling to provide informative messages to users.
*   **Scalability:** The project might not be optimized for scalability. Consider using caching, database optimization, and other techniques to improve performance for a large number of users.
*   **UI/UX:** the UI is basic, for a user friendly site make sure to focus on the UI and UX by adding more styling and by using a proper CSS framework.
